Well, I thought I was going to do a fiscal analysis of your budget and spend every month, but after purposefully shaking your trees by threatening to do such just to see how'd you'd react: I don't really see a point.

Here's my working assumptions:

From what I can tell, a legal entity - a firm or a newly created firm - had an opportunity starting in 2022 to work with numerous clients vis - a - vis me, for the purposes of being able to use video of me which you filmed in my privacy without asking, non consensually, for some sort of streaming "Reality" show.

At such a point, I tricked you into thinking I was psychotic or delusional, more or less, because I was offended you were spying on me under the premise of mental health. Maybe I could have taken different approaches, but through 2022 I misjudged my audience in many ways. If this happens again, I will take a different approach, that's for sure. Faking symptoms of delusions or psychosis is, well, time consuming as a tactic. That said, I'm sure you've figured all that out by now because, well, you're pretty good.

You were hired to make sure my "psychosis" would result in a legal declaration of my lack of mental capacity one way or another which would take away my ability to consent to being filmed. However, you were hired before anyone realized how ~~Abel~~ able I was. Since then, things have changed.

Your **former** clients have realized this and have told you they're out of the project, unless you can turn it around of course. In order to protect themselves legally, they are likely not funding you at this point.

And thus, to legally protect your former clients, this project is being "funded" by the legal firm's partners because without it, you will lose your biggest opportunities and reputations. You've put your own personal fortunes on the line here. You've hired consultants of various kinds under your firm, but the funding comes from the firm itself, not the original clients, for legal reasons mostly, which says a lot about the firm's abilities.

So now, you have to either "trick" me into appearing psychotic, or somehow make a convincing argument to medical professionals (which you are not) that I am psychotic, and all with numerous people watching you make fools of yourself. Just because some lawyers can read the DSM doesn't mean they'll make a convincing argument to medical professionals, whom often have to be wary that the law isn't the healthiest thing out there, so I'm not worried.

It's your own money you're spending, so pointing out how you're wasting your money isn't really going to stop you, so I won't.

Furthermore, the DSM is not a legal text, it is a medical text. Literally from the DSM-V itself:

> Although the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria and text are primarily designed to assist clinicians in conducting clinical assessment, case formulation, and treatment planning, DSM-5 is also used as a reference for the courts and attorneys in assessing the legal consequences of mental disorders. As a result, it is important to note that the definition of mental disorder included in DSM-5 was developed to meet the needs of clinicians, public health professionals, and research investigators rather than the technical needs of the courts and legal professionals.

That is why in court situations, a medical expert is required, a lawyer cannot simply back a diagnosis with "evidence" and "arguments" using the DSM. A medical professional makes a diagnosis not with spying on patients but in coordination with the patient, exceptions being when the patient has been forcibly committed by the state in cases of violence. I have not pled guilty to any violent crimes, unfortunately for you, and cannot be committed. This is the flaw to your approach and it reveals your desperation: medical professionals will not back your ludicrous argument and a bunch of lawyers seem to think they can make one that will convince medical professionals. You're bending over backwards, treating your legal hammer as though everything is a nail, a classic mistake of professionalism. Desperation is the only explanation. But why?

My guess is that while functioning as my sister's divorce lawyers, you told a Judge that I was definitively psychotic though I had no official diagnosis and the evidence shown was just me acting - you were just spying on me, not making a medically ethical diagnosis - that's the truth. Willfully misinterpreting the truth is grounds for disbarment, unless of course, you can prove a lie as the truth. Shouldn't be too hard for big show lawyers like you, right? After all, I'm only one man.

Game on, I suppose. Your careers are depending on it, if you cannot prove I'm something I'm not, you will eventually be disbarred. You've already lost your biggest business opportunities and made fools of yourselves on an impossibly big stage, there simply is no other explanation for your continued pursuit at the cost you've taken. If you don't win, don't worry - I'll still see you in hell. I'll be the guy wearing a vistor's pass.
