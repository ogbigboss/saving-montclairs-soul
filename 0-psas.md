A note to my supporters: I am requesting you do not go out of your way to gesture to me in my physical form. Meaning, if you know I'm walking down such and such street due to the network of stalkers alerting you on my whereabouts, I'm asking you to stay where you are. I'm walking God's path here and I'm more than confident that I'm on fate's "right" hand side. Though I appreciate the effort I don't need it. Furthermore, I want to isolate my forced interactions with those that seem to think they are against me for whatever reason, or seek some gain in manipulating my thoughts. I want to better understand the broken hearts of those that need mending such to aide this community in rebuilding itself.

Furthermore, if you're paid to walk by me and do some shenanigan to distract me, that's fine. The broken hearted need you to seem like they have more support than they do, they need you to seem like they are more diverse demographically then they are; they need you to lie for them to make it seem like their previous lies about me were true. Understand this and *charge them double*. You and I both know they have the money and their backs are against the wall at this moment, take advantage of them taking advantage of economic inequality. I see no harm in it, though I see right through it. It's not exactly the meek inheriting the earth, but it's close enough for me to feel spiritually aligned with it. *Make sure you're getting paid more than before.*

And for those working towards social connections, save evidence of every interaction you have for future legal purposes should the "shit hit the fan" either way, such that when it's time to collect you can "charge double" in terms of social leverage for whatever it is you're after later on, as well as CYA.
