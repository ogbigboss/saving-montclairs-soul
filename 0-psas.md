A note to my supporters: I am requesting you do not go out of your way to gesture to me in my physical form. Meaning, if you know I'm walking down such and such street due to the network of stalkers alerting you on my whereabouts, I'm asking you to stay where you are. I'm walking God's path here and I'm more than confident that I'm on fate's "right" hand side. Though I appreciate the effort I don't need it. Furthermore, I want to isolate my forced interactions with those that seem to think they are against me for whatever reason, or seek some gain in manipulating my thoughts. I want to better understand the broken hearts of those that need mending such to aide this community in rebuilding itself.

Furthermore, if you're paid to walk by me and do some shenanigan to distract me, that's fine. The broken hearted need you to seem like they have more support than they do, they need you to seem like they are more diverse demographically then they are; they need you to lie for them to make it seem like their previous lies about me were true. Understand this and *charge them double*. You and I both know they have the money and their backs are against the wall at this moment, take advantage of them taking advantage of economic inequality. I see no harm in it, though I see right through it. It's not exactly the meek inheriting the earth, but it's close enough for me to feel spiritually aligned with it. *Make sure you're getting paid more than before.*

And for those working towards social connections, save evidence of every interaction you have for future legal purposes should the "shit hit the fan" either way, such that when it's time to collect you can "charge double" in terms of social leverage for whatever it is you're after later on, as well as CYA.

A note to atheists: if you're reading this, it's likely not because you're looking to get into the idea of religion, and that's cool. I'd just like to tell you what I think "religion" is. In Ancient Egypt, Ra was the highest of all the imagined gods, and represented the Sun. It's my thought that the Ancient Egyptians, lacking modern science, created Ra to explain the phenomenon of the Sun and how yes, nearly all life on this planet revolves around and requires it.

So, I think "religion" is a poetic way to explain what cannot (yet) be ascertained by science.

If you are an atheist, I am assuming you hold science to a high degree of worth, and are equally worried about climate change as I am. Perhaps you've heard of a conceptualized god like presence often referred to as Mother Nature? It's my thought that maybe, if there is a purely scientific explanation for these events, it would relate to Mother Nature being worried about our planet, and realizing Montclair NJ is a special place.

I think she knows that the planet Earth is still ruled by a Patriarchy, and I'm guessing she's also read Margaret Atwood's _The Handmaid's Tale_ (I'll admit I've only read synopses at this point), and is afraid of what climate change will do to women in particular. Perhaps our planet, somewhere in that mystifying combination beauty and beast that we call Mother Nature for lack of better definition, has some kind of "social ecology," or a layer of influence that sets off certain "butterfly effects" purely for the purpose of social change that will defend the planet's welfare. I think we're all experiencing that through these events.

Furthermore, Montclair NJ is full of _wealth_ and it's teens and early 20 year olds will inherit it and become part of our planet's Patriarchal ruling class, whether they are women or men. If they all learn that stalking, spying, and gaslighting is an acceptable form of ascendancy into a power structure, then I fear that if the terrorism these children and young adults have been taught is not undone, then Margaret Atwood will be a prophet, and the Patriarchy will win.

Much like the Ancient Egyptians, I don't think we have the scientific acumen to explain how a planet could possibly have not a _physical_ but a _social_ influence on it's population, but just like how in modern times it's more appropriate to speak of the Sun as a scientific concept rather than as a god - I think we'll figure it out later.

Given how much of Montclair NJ's teenage and 20 year old population will represent the power structure that takes over in a world descending into Climate Change, it is why I feel so strongly that they must be untaught the negative lessons many of their parents taught them in this exercise of anti-fame. Will their children go on to persecute populations as their parents are teaching them such to preserve resources, or will they fight for justice and save the human population from as much death as possible?

Unless Atwood is a prophet, I'm hoping that the work we're doing here to better Montclair NJ can indeed prevent the Patriarchal dystopia represented by _The Handmaid's Tale_.
