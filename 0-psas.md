A note to my supporters: I am requesting you do not go out of your way to gesture to me in my physical form. Meaning, if you know I'm walking down such and such street due to the network of stalkers alerting you on my whereabouts, I'm asking you to stay where you are. I'm walking God's path here and I'm more than confident that I'm on fate's "right" hand side. Though I appreciate the effort I don't need it. Furthermore, I want to isolate my forced interactions with those that seem to think they are against me for whatever reason, or seek some gain in manipulating my thoughts. I want to better understand the broken hearts of those that need mending such to aide this community in rebuilding itself.

Furthermore, if you're paid to walk by me and do some shenanigan to distract me, that's fine. The broken hearted need you to seem like they have more support than they do, they need you to seem like they are more diverse demographically then they are; they need you to lie for them to make it seem like their previous lies about me were true. Understand this and *charge them double*. You and I both know they have the money and their backs are against the wall at this moment, take advantage of them taking advantage of economic inequality. I see no harm in it, though I see right through it. It's not exactly the meek inheriting the earth, but it's close enough for me to feel spiritually aligned with it. *Make sure you're getting paid more than before.*

And for those working towards social connections, save evidence of every interaction you have for future legal purposes should the "shit hit the fan" either way, such that when it's time to collect you can "charge double" in terms of social leverage for whatever it is you're after later on, as well as CYA.

A note to atheists: if you're reading this, it's likely not because you're looking to get into the idea of religion, and that's cool. I'd just like to tell you what I think "religion" is. In Ancient Egypt, Ra was the highest of all the imagined gods, and represented the Sun. It's my thought that the Ancient Egyptians, lacking modern science, created Ra to explain the phenomenon of the Sun and how yes, nearly all life on this planet revolves around and requires it.

So, I think "religion" is a poetic way to explain what cannot (yet) be ascertained by science.

If you are an atheist, I am assuming you hold science to a high degree of worth, and are equally worried about climate change as I am. Perhaps you've heard of a conceptualized god like presence often referred to as Mother Nature? It's my thought that maybe, if there is a purely scientific explanation for these events, it would relate to Mother Nature being worried about our planet, and realizing Montclair NJ is a special place.

I think she knows that the planet Earth is still ruled by a Patriarchy, and I'm guessing she's also read Margaret Atwood's _The Handmaid's Tale_ (I'll admit I've only read synopses at this point), and is afraid of what climate change will do to women in particular. Perhaps our planet, somewhere in that mystifying combination beauty and beast that we call Mother Nature for lack of better definition, has some kind of "social ecology," or a layer of influence that sets off certain "butterfly effects" purely for the purpose of social change that will defend the planet's welfare. I think we're all experiencing that through these events.

Furthermore, Montclair NJ is full of _wealth_ and it's teens and early 20 year olds will inherit it and become part of our planet's Patriarchal ruling class, whether they are women or men. If they all learn that stalking, spying, and gaslighting is an acceptable form of ascendancy into a power structure, then I fear that if the terrorism these children and young adults have been taught is not undone, then Margaret Atwood will be a prophet, and the Patriarchy will win.

Much like the Ancient Egyptians, I don't think we have the scientific acumen to explain how a planet could possibly have not a _physical_ but a _social_ influence on it's population, but just like how in modern times it's more appropriate to speak of the Sun as a scientific concept rather than as a god - I think we'll figure it out later.

Given how much of Montclair NJ's teenage and 20 year old population will represent the power structure that takes over in a world descending into Climate Change, it is why I feel so strongly that they must be untaught the negative lessons many of their parents taught them in this exercise of anti-fame. Will their children go on to persecute populations as their parents are teaching them such to preserve resources, or will they fight for justice and save the human population from as much death as possible?

Unless Atwood is a prophet, I'm hoping that the work we're doing here to better Montclair NJ can indeed prevent the Patriarchal dystopia represented by _The Handmaid's Tale_.

An announcement: I am no longer seeking compensation, in either financial form or via the codifying of medical consent etc laws to prevent this. In the past I've said as much to just underline that what you were doing to me was criminal, in an effort to get you to go away.

Had I realized divorce lawyers were advertising their services in front of potential celebrity clientele when I started to speak this way - which was mid 2022 by the way - I maybe would've taken a different tact, as only divorce lawyers would see it as a challenge to break the law brazenly and get away with it to prove to their clients they would do anything to screw over their ex. I guess it's one way to make a living.

However, I now realize that God's will for me - to help heal the community of Montclair NJ, particularly it's children - will be stunted if I were to receive compensation. I do not want children to see my path as a way to a fortune, even if it is just.

I also realize that the events that caused you to come after me were due to how unique of a person I am, and nothing else. I'm guessing a certain sister had made me a small subject of Hollywood fame before my own sister did, but that's a pill to take for another day. It's just to say, I've taken the tact I have - trying to get you to go away based on pointing out your criminal behavior - to prevent you from doing this to other people. But... the reason you did this to me is because, well, I'm a unique One.

I no longer fear you going after other people like this considering how unique I am, therefore I don't need the compensation in financial or legal form. It would also teach the wrong lesson to the corrupted parents, whom would later be able to claim my moral stances were fraudulent efforts at a pay off. They are not.

I'll outline this and more in my "Is that what you get for your money" budget analysis. I'm guessing your lawyers see it as rational, and correctly, to continue spending six figures a month to come after me in the fear of the compensation you would owe me if you _didn't_ smear or frame me, and realizing the six figures was cheaper (though I imagine by 2025 that wouldn't be the case, hopefully that won't have to come to pass).

But mostly, I'm walking God's path. I do think it'd be wise of you to compensate me somewhat in order to make it easier to sign away my right to make legal claims against you, but I'll leave that up to you. I just want this community to be able to heal itself, and it's children to learn from this to prepare for a growingly uncertain future coming from the heaven besides them as well as the hell within their own communities.

After an evening of rest and a morning of reflection, I'd just like to double down on yesterday's position: I am no longer seeking compensation in financial or legal form, nor am I seeking any form of "revenge" or "vengeance" - I'm dropping the sword.

I think god wanted me to understand my anger as less valuable than my love - while my anger allowed for this situation to reveal a true darkness within the heart of Montclair NJ's parenting and family community, it is my love that can truly heal it.

And love doesn't need nor seek a reward other than it's own existence.

So I'd like to say, again, that I am no longer seeking financial or legal compensation for the actions taken against me, no matter how illegal or medically unethical they were.

I only seek value out of sharing my love for change, and to see this community of Montclair NJ change through these events such that it can learn to greet celebrity, fame, and wealth as a vehicle for love, and not for vengeance.

Growing up in Montclair, one thing has always been uncertain: Will that restaurant / store survive?

To the Montclair small business association: I know many of you, particularly the restaurants on Bloomfield near the MC Hotel, as well as the Hotel itself, have experienced a great boon by this religious event we're all living through. You don't want this to end, and many of you may need it to continue.

Here is my offer to you: many religious events are commemorated with an annual holiday. I'm not sure what day - or days - would be best, perhaps maybe a week, but if this ends and I am in a decent enough position in life, I promise that I'll come back every year, and I will encourage the C*lb**ts, the R*d*e**, and other prominent residents to invite their friends at this time. In the spirit of the event, I'll walk around town ignoring all of them and stopping by places for coffee while they spend more money then I ever could.

As a township, ask yourself this: is one boom worth it, or would an annual event that guarantees a rearrival, coordinated against shows at the Welmont perhaps, be better?

Let's make the long term play here gang, not just for the future of Montclair's wayward youth, but for the future of Montclair's small businesses as well.

Just want you to know I'm thinking of how to preserve the financial growth that would turn into a vacuum if this event ends, and I'll keep the small business owners of Montclair in mind. As long as I am allowed to continue walking God's path unhampered, I will make sure God's path comes back to Montclair.

Might I be risking turning into a pillar of salt? I don't think so.

As high schoolers, some of us walked eastward every now and then to an underpass which was hidden enough for us to smoke weed and chill. We'd call it Mecca, given that we had to walk east. It was in Bloomfield, technically, but I digress.

I'd like to think my annual trips back to Montclair could be seen as something of a pilgrimage to Mecca: a Mecca of small business success!

Remember: I brought the crowd here, I can bring them back. People just like following me, I guess.
