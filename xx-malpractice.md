> _Your love is like bad medicine, bad medicine is what [no one] need[s]_ - Bon Jovi, "Bad Medicine"

- intro

- point one: hippocrates, origins of oath
- point two: nuremburg trials, wwii + the nazis, the modernization of the oath, you dislocated my shoulder assaulting me for this experiment violating the nuremburg code and you will deny and cover this up violating basic medical ethics
- point three: children will grow up untrusting of medicine and psychology, or will learn that weaponizing them in the service of industry or government is appropriate, bringing us back to at least the Nazi era of medicine.

- outro
