> _Your love is like bad medicine, bad medicine is what [no one] need[s]_ - Bon Jovi, "Bad Medicine"

- intro

- point one: hippocrates, origins of oath
- point two: nuremburg trials, wwii + the nazis, the modernization of the oath, you dislocated my shoulder assaulting me for this experiment violating the nuremburg code and you will deny and cover this up violating basic medical ethics
- point three: children will grow up untrusting of medicine and psychology, or will learn that weaponizing them in the service of industry or government is appropriate, bringing us back to at least the Nazi era of medicine.

- outro: a plea to leave my family alone. my father has expressed suicidal thoughts, my mother has waved this away as "bangladeshi culture", and they've both been told to lie to me - how can their mental health truly be evaluated when they've been trained to lie for over a year now? why wouldn't they lie or put on a good show in front of an audience if they knew they were being questioned on their mental health in a venue where they are trying to retain custody of their grandkids by trying to prove that I am the one that is mentally unstable? This is a breeding ground for mental disorders as they are being told to lie - they will not be honest about their own mental health until it may be too late. Furthermore my father does most of the driving and I fear the pressure - he told me himself that he feels an immense amount of pressure when explaining why he didn't want to live anymore, but couldn't tell me what the pressure was about in detail for some reason - may get to him in the form of a car accident. Fraud, deceit, and intentional misrepresentation are no nos for lawyers. My parents aren't lawyers but I think the people telling them to lie will also encourage them to intentionally misrepresent their own mental health. stop this.
