# Intro to Saving Montclair's Soul

> _Allow me to reintroduce myself, my name is [not] [Je]Hov[a]_ - Jay-Z, "Public Service Announcement"

If you're watching or reading this, I won't bother wasting breath on the earthly details as to why we're all together in this way: it's probably not worth it. However, as these events have unraveled that have brought us all together, I've often wondered, well, _what's it all mean?_ Juxtaposing myself against impossibly large figures like athletes, entertainers, politicians, and American history itself has always felt uncomfortable against my own personal story - I'm just not that big of a deal. However, all those juxtapositions occurred and eventually brought me back to my hometown in Montclair NJ. It took me awhile to accept but I now believe we are all living in a truly religious event - whether you believe in a Jewish Adonai, a Christian God, a Muslim Allah, a polytheistic grouping of deities, "magic", or a combination / mixture of all these things, I believe they brought us together for this reason:

Montclair NJ is supposed to be a special place. It is supposed to be a _moral_ community above all else, and a leader of progressive values. Montclair NJ has failed in this calling with my re-arrival and has instead allowed it's community to "other" me, smear me without cause, and spy on me using elaborate technologies, but that isn't the biggest sin here. The biggest sin is that Montclair NJ has _taught_ these anti-community values to it's children, whom are too young to understand and accept that their community is too toxic to be trusted at face value.

...

Though I am neither a God nor an Angel, I am reminded of the story of _Sodom and Gomorrah_ from the Old Testament. Two angels visit a town they have heard is full of sin, and the town proves this by persecuting the angels themselves as outsiders, immigrants without proper citizenship, and threaten them in a quite ghastly and oft confused way.

No, Montclair 2,024 years after the death of Christ isn't as violent as Biblical times. Violence is often the implication of the phrase "Biblical times" after all. However, the vehicle for the sin remains and parks away from violence as it is illegal in our modern times. That does not mean this behavior has been without sin. But if God wanted fire and brimstone to destroy the towns of Sodom and Gomorrah, what does God wish for Montclair NJ?

I think God brought me back to this town as a similar test of the Angels in _Sodom and Gomorrah_ - if Montclair NJ hadn't of become a community corrupt of values, so corrupt it espouses persecution and "othering" amongst it's own children, and teaches them how to pursue anti-humanist behaviors while getting away with it legally, then my arrival wouldn't have been such a community affair, or it would have been ended by the community itself long ago.

I believe God brought us all together so the parenting and leadership community of Montclair NJ can recognize how distorted this town has become, that it only has dirty mirrors which hide it's reflection and allow it's citizens to assume such lies as the truth, that the dirt is only on the mirror and not truly a part of their own image.

...

That said - this is a holy moment. No matter what "side" you may lay upon with regards to the greater moral issue, I'd like for us all to take a moment to appreciate that. You're just not going to live through anything else like this, something which has encompassed the highest degree of politics and celebrity, two things Montclair has always indulged in but clearly has immaturely misunderstood. In turn, those politicians and celebrities at large and for the most part are more interested in my relationship with Montclair NJ then they are with their own fame's relation to this event. Without fame being involved, Montclair parents just wouldn't pay attention, and that's a big part of the problem.

God wanted the participation of the politician and celebrity class to be so much leverage for the wake up call that Montclair's community must go through. Otherwise the issue would be ignored.

So if you're living through this moment with me, I want you to take some time reflecting on how this _feels_. Take your average romps of celebrity or political indulgence, understand those emotions, and tease them out from the current one. The emotions you are left with, once you've cut the fat - that is it.

The core emotional difference to this moment and all others in your life is the very presence of God Herself.

It is my feeling that for many of you, you were exposed to this event simply to understand what it feels like when the hand of God intervenes on your life in anyway.

With our country going through coups and contemplating climate change, it is my feeling that the hand of God may come to intervene amongst the spiritually aligned to protect them from harm, similar to the innocent animals saved by Noah and his Ark.

In the future, the emotion you are feeling that is unique to this event will re-occur, and God wants you to know what that feels like, so when you are the main character in a series of Godly events, you will know that your actions are bigger than just you.

So for those of us not necessarily tethered by real estate or relations to Montclair NJ, please remember the _emotional_ uniqueness of this moment.

...

Finally, and perhaps most uniquely, this moment's legal peculiarities disallow anyone or myself to communicate directly, face to face, about these happenings, at least at the current moment. Why would God set things up in such a way?

I believe this has to do with the true meaning of art; after all, artists rarely have a true dialogue with all those that interpret their art, and neither can I.

Many chase Art as a status symbol, or even worse, as an investment. Artists, however, imbibe their work with meaning, often personal, but as art is to be shared, what is personal to one human always reflects on others, and the art becomes a vehicle for understanding that humanity is a _shared_ experience.

So understand my "content" to be in the form of Art - it is not up to the Artist to instigate true change, nor has there even been an Artist that has instigated true change. There is a law named after Eddie Murphy based on the finale of the movie _Trading Places_, but it took Congress some 3 decades after the movie came out to introduce it, and Eddie Murphy wasn't a congress person. This is to say the affect that Art can have to change society is not on the artist, but on society. The ability for society to impact change as led by Artists is then up to one thing: a community's ability to understand the meaning of art.

I cannot lead this town into any kind of change directly, nor will I. I believe God has given me this platform, deniability included, such to challenge Montclair to understand me as an artist, to understand this as both an act and the Art of God, and to leave it to the Parenting community to interpret this art for the benefit of their children, not just so they can talk about it at a social gathering, and certainly not so they can profit from it.

I believe Montclair NJ has lost it's way when it comes to understanding the Art created by the Artists it wishes to be represented by. These events are God's way of helping Montclair through the intellectual struggle that understanding and appreciating Art should imply, and the _change_ that art wishes to bring to the mindset of so many, such to better the future of Montclair's children.

During hurricane Sandy, I was living in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, surrounded by community housing projects, about a half mile's walk from the Financial District. The Financial District was cut off from power for weeks. My former area, and many of the less wealthy areas of the city, did not suffer as much, interestingly enough, our power restored within days. I've always wondered what God meant by that. That said, climate change hasn't taken full form yet. If Montclair cannot repair itself from the sins that this situation has revealed that the Township indeed revels in, well, fire and brimstone may not be too far away.

But let us not lose hope: if God could put all this together, that means God truly believes in Montclair NJ as a _family_ community, so with the presence of God there is truly always the presence of Hope. For those of us not connected to Montclair or perhaps too young to fully appreciate Godly spiritualism, I believe God wants you to know the _feeling_ of their presence, such that when it is your time to take a more meaningful role in such events, you will understand the importance of what you are living through. And finally, I believe God has challenged Montclair NJ specifically because of the Town's relationship to Art, and to remind the town that Art is a vehicle for change of mentality, not just bragging rights and Sotheby's.

One of my favorite Springsteen tracks is _Local Hero_ from the album _Lucky Town_. It is his tenth studio album, and well after his own personal success was codified. My interpretation of it is that it is his answer to himself as to why, despite having millions of dollars and a young family circa the early 90s, why would he want to keep doing the rock n roll thing? My interpretation is that he only does it to inspire others to do the same. Considering the legion of musicians that cite him as an inspiration, I'd think he has found success. I similarly have persisted in this situation, and will persist, so I can inspire others to better their communities, even in times of high sin, even when it seems like the whole community has turned against them. Sometimes, in the face of sin, it is better to learn to turn the other cheek, and not as an example of moral righteousness, but as an example of moral community leadership.
