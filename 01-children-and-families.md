For those that don't know, we got here because my estranged sister told Hollywood Reality Producers that I may be a "cyber criminal", and could be a good speculative spin off from their _Razzlekhan_ series. When it turned out that our estrangement didn't mean she could say I was whatever she wished (I'm not a cyber criminal), the TV show turned to embarrassing me. I think this is because I made fun of the surveillance on me as unfruitful if not corrupt in spirit, and I thus hurt the egos of TV producers, whom at the time of early 2022 had divorce lawyers by their side due to the then upcoming _Depp v. Heard_ series.

After the attempt to make a true crime show out of me was disturbed by the truth being I'm not a criminal, they stalked my private online therapy sessions, at which point they told my parents of the difficulties I had with them, which I was telling my therapist. Apparently my sister wasn't enough leverage to smear me. At that point my parents, whom I was also estranged with, became defensive to my difficulties. 

My parents then also participated in trying to set me up for a weird prank show, to show Hollywood and the various audiences my sister rallied that they were right: though I wasn't a criminal, I still deserved to be spied upon and have my privacy violated. It was then up to Hollywood lawyers to find a legal means to get around my consent. I thought I was having a private conversation with my therapist, not signing up for a psychological research show centering around a prank.

The "prank" involved, and still involves, trying to convince me my nephew is in a coma, of all things. I think it's based on a _Sopranos_ episode titled _Home Movies_, but that's an aside.

My sister's husband and my nephew's father, to my estimation, wasn't included in this decision to use his son for a Reality TV prank show, and used it as a grounds for divorce. The custody judge, to my estimation, gave my sister a choice akin to the famed Judgement of Solomon.

The custody Judge told my sister that given her decision making against her own brother, and that she is raising siblings (she has twins), that they felt it appropriate for her husband to have the majority of custody. However, if the show can be made to prove that I, her brother, is the problem - me! - then the custody decision can be reversed. I believe the Judge was trying to tell my sister that if she were two mothers, the mother that wouldn't encourage Hollywood to stalk and harass her brother would be the better mother to her own child, but it's just my estimation. I suppose Hollywood producers and divorce lawyers, teaming up already to make shows surrounding and impacting famous divorce proceedings, promised my sister they'd prove the Judge incorrect, and my sister and parents chose the power of fame over family values and forgiveness.

So the show must go on in my parents and sister's eyes, otherwise they have no shot at custody of their children / grand children.

And that's why we're all still here. But that's not the only problem - too many of the children of Montclair NJ know about this, and the trauma it is doing to them in terms of pursuing the bedrock of our society: making families themselves.

Montclair children are being turned off and traumatized to the concept of families, marriage, and child birth by this situation. No functioning community can exist without this. It is a great moral dilemma.

I think God set this up in this way, _Sopranos_ and Solomon included, so that when I returned to Montclair, the corrupted souls of some Montclair parents would not be able to resist the gossip. With so much comparative art involved, I'd have an easy path to referencing that and history in such a way to instill in the parenting community of Montclair that this is too coincidental _not_ to be a spiritual aligned event, and their own tastes in art would not let them ignore the issues brought up by this tragedy of family values.

...

I am now in the house to which I spent the majority of my childhood, where my sister spent roughly half of hers (we moved a bit before landing in Montclair), and to which we shared much time together. Growing up, I would never have thought she would have taken a path which would guarantee harming me at the profit of her career connections to Hollywood, though she did dream of being an actress. I'm not sure if seeing _Mulholland Drive_ at that age would've helped, but I digress.

One of the greatest damages we have all done to Montclair's children is to instill in them a story that literalizes - albeit in slow motion and with a hopeful twist of me not being murdered - Cain and Abel's. They were the firstborn sons of Adam and Eve after the couple left the Garden of Eden. Both grew to become farmers, and at some point made sacrifices to God. Abel sacrificed the better part of his yield; Cain the less. God clearly favored Abel's sacrifice. In a fit of jealousy, Cain murdered Abel, and tried to cover it up in front of God to no avail.

My sister wanted connections to Hollywood for her own pursuits, tried to sell me as some sort of sacrifice, which backfired as I became some sort of inspirational muse to the musical side of tinsel town instead of her pathway in. As this has worsened, she has continued to accelerate this action, sacrificing her own marriage and custody of children at the altar of fame. This begs an interesting question which I fear has become a contest of sorts: who is Hollywood's true god, that which inspires story and song, or divorce lawyers?

Parents raise their children in Montclair for all kinds of reasons, but lately the connections the town has to avenues of all kinds of fame may elevate over it's easy commute to NYC. Children of Montclair, especially those being raised by parents that approve or have participated in this theater, must now question whether or not their own brother or sister will grow up to be like mine.

_Will my sibling attempt to sacrifice me for their own success, and triangulate entire industries as well as our parents against me?_; they ask themselves.

I'm not sure there is an easy answer here, particularly for parents that have expressed positivity or have socialized around this show's filming. Truly, I think the only way to protect the children of Montclair from this upside down Biblical tale where many of you root on Cain is to tell them, flat out, that this was morally wrong of my sister and the divorce lawyers whom have tricked her into acting in an anti-family manner as a mother and a sister. And if the parents whom have failed to blame it on Cain cannot do this, then other parents must help the children and siblings of Montclair to not repeat the sins of my sister.

Divorce is, of course, a needed process for many marriages. Things don't always work out. Many children grow up fine and unscathed from such situations, if not most. Psychology analyzes difficulties children have by their ages; many young children blame themselves and even attempt to repair their parent's marriage.

Many of Montclair's children of divorce, particularly those that blamed themselves, must now be asking themselves an inverted question from the idea that the child caused the divorce:

_Did the divorce lawyers manipulate my parents?_

It's unclear to me if my sister would have felt confident at all in facing a divorce with custody issues if it weren't for Hollywood lawyers, particularly those behind the show _Depp v. Heard_, whom as of 2022 must have been riding a high horse of success.

_Of course we'll win: we have Hollywood on our side, and your ex doesn't_ is what they must have told my sister, what they must have told my parents.

On the other side, as my own tale haunted not just Hollywood but Silicon Valley and Washington DC, the divorce lawyers at my sister's side must have taken this competitively. If they can win, they will be able to expand their clientele to not just Hollywood but also politics, big tech, and more. My sister's successful custody, which they've botched, is their pathway to an expanded presence in this world.

Leaving the children of Montclair, surrounded by a growing population of fame and fortune, with another question:

_Did my parents get a divorce so their divorce lawyers could make a good impression on other potential clients in Montclair? Was my childhood disrupted purely because a lawyer convinced my parent it would be better when in fact it wasn't?_

And ultimately:

_What's the point of family anyway?_

Family is the bedrock of our society and always has been. This situation may traumatize Montclair's children into never trusting the concept of family again. Divorce lawyers have proven to them that they can alter a parent's perception, including my own, such to do great harm and damage to an otherwise happy household.

...

In modern times, many worry about a population crisis occurring: that we're not creating enough human beings to guarantee humanity's survival.

The Hebrew Bible, or the Miqra, brings us the story of King Solomon's Judgement. In it, two mothers are arguing to Solomon that they are both the true mother to a child. As DNA tests nor Maury Povich were around at that time, King Solomon made a now famous fib: he tells the mothers that to solve this issue, he will cut the baby in half, giving each mother one half of the child. The false mother agrees, whereas the true mother is aghast, and tells Solomon to give the child to the other mother. Although she disagrees, she would rather the child live than be split in two.

Solomon then reveals he was lying, and awards the second mother the child, saying that the true mother to a child would never agree to seeing their child harmed for the sake of their own pride.

My sister, and my own parents, have failed in a modern version of King Solomon's tale, opting to do harm to me in order to preserve their own pride. There were plenty of options to talk things through, and yet they've taken this one. While I am forgiving myself - my father listens to my mother at all costs, my mother has always had issues with empathy and has rarely kept or understood the company of others without a fair amount of distance, and my sister was manipulated by her own desire to be an actress - I have to consider the effect this has on the children of Montclair.

I myself have doubts I'll ever marry or have kids as a result of this experience. I can't help but feel that children exposed to this situation may be considering the same.

Why even _risk_ going through something like this? Particularly as society becomes less financially equal, if they are to marry someone of more prestige, would that hurt them? Or, worse, if they were to be more prestigious than their spouse, would those in their social circle use conflict to break apart their marriage, damage their children, all for the sake of utilizing their upper hand in terms of prestige?

Even a delay of mother nature's intent will impact upcoming populations, particularly if this story is to blossom any further. I can't say I have easy answer save for this: my sister and parents could take a more Godly, family first path to end this story, and of course I would help them.

...

From an email sent to my sister:

> If you're willing to tell the Judge, with the parents, [that] you were wrong for this, I am more than willing to back you up, such that I can be a voice for your better custody. I think given the arguments you made against me were the justification for your wanting custody, if you and I both reversed it, that is your best bet with a Judge given that, well, I'm not exactly on a moral low ground here.
>
> Think of [the children]: They deserve to be close to their mother, it will be better for them. Please think of your children and not your career or your pride.
>
> Furthermore, given how twisted this all became, I think if you reversed course you'd have a chance to change counsel and sue your previous counsel for pushing you down this path. They had motivations for celebrity clientele and Depp v. Heard style television shows, not you or your children's best futures in mind. Financially speaking that may be the best thing you can do for [you and your children's] futures.

If this path can become the true ending to this story, that is my only hope towards this being resolved in a way that will benefit family values for those affected in Montclair and beyond. Stories like this risk our very planet's and human race's future as they prevent children from wanting families of their own. I hope together, as a community, we can find a better path, if not for my family than perhaps for all of yours.

One thing I remind myself daily is another adage of King Solomon's: _this too shall pass_.
