### A pause and an explanation

So, I should admit, while I do feel morally and spiritually adhered to this project and whatever meaning the residents of Montclair may perceive of it, I had another gambit.

I wished to cajole the community to act in my defense against the legal actors attempting to portray me as mentally incapable, if not dangerous to the state, or at least more dangerous then the necessity of these "sermons" prove them to be.

However, in coming to the recent deduction that this is, or has become, a legal disciplinary investigation on the behalf of one or more State Bar Associations, I'm going to take a pause here. I may come back, or I may not. That said, it's clear that the community of Montclair was, to some extent, aware of this legal disciplinary investigation taking place - though such a thing is supposed to be confidential, I imagine the same could have been said about my formerly private life.

To the town of Montclair: kudos. I've misjudged many to most of you. Not all, I presume. Anyway.

...

I got in this mess because I chose a hill to die upon, so to speak.

It is, with every passing minute, easier and easier for those with a power imbalance to "spy" on others, and without the warrant of a military conflict or even a legal situation. Simply put, someone who is richer than another person these days can spy on someone else, and they don't even have to be all that clever about it. From my favorite television show, whose actors can look as hard to their right as they want and I will never stop adoring them, _Burn Notice_:

> One of the toughest challenges is using information that you're not supposed to have.

The power or wealth imbalance that is more and more common to this world, and especially this country, does not change the above.

So, if you think that your utility of spying on anyone is of automatic value, I've made it my "mission" to prove that such a thing is not a gun with a barrel you can easily point away from you without it backfiring and injuring yourself, similar to the [sculpture](https://www.un.org/ungifts/non-violence-0) that rests outside of the United Nations building in Manhattan, which is a gun with a twisted barrel.

I did not start playing this game making or recording any type of "media" or "content," just running my mouth in areas which should have been private, lest someone was listening without my consent. I only started any kind of "content production" when realizing it was more than likely those that were spying on me were well past attempting to do the same.

That said, the "content" was produced as a defensive procedure: it would be harder to make a television show of false claims about me if I had contemporaneous recordings of various media that cast a different light on the points attempted to be made by the aforementioned show.

Seeing as how this is most likely beyond a TV show meant to smear me, and now a legal disciplinary investigation on the part of the lawyers who orchestrated the attempt to smear me while mis representing my mental health in their capacity as court officers as well as liasons to law enforcement, I don't feel a need to be as defensive.

That said, my favorite part of this game has always been just talking shit to "myself" and allowing those listening to feel confident that there must be something they can use against me, that their surveillance in tandem with their Juris Doctorates was a gun with a straightened barrel, not one that would misfire or blow apart in their hands as the one in the sculpture mentioned above likely would if fired (I find the sculpture's name of "non violence" to be a bit of a non sequiter, but alas). So I'll probably continue that game, for anyone listening.

I hope the State Bar associations may feel otherwise and allow me a chance to represent my mental capacity directly, thus ending this unfortunate period of all of our lives. This is their decision and not mine. From an email sent to the State Bars potentially involved:

> Hello,
> 
> I’m not a lawyer, but I feel I may be the focal point of another lawyer’s attorney discipline investigation.
> 
> If this is so, I’d like a chance to learn more and represent myself. I am of capable mental capacity, and I have never pled guilty to a violent crime, so I see no reason why I shouldn’t be able to have a say.
> 
> As a citizen of the US, I feel it is a bedrock implication of the legal process to be able to represent oneself when they are being judged, even if they are technically not the one on trial.
> 
> That said, I’m presuming that attorney disciplinary investigations are confidential, so even if I am mistaken and I am not involved in such a thing, you may not be able to let me know in the first place.

Finally - I'd like to at least summarize the sermons I was, and may still, give.

1. Medical Malpractice is, as the words insinuate, bad. Showing a community how one can get away with it, even when it is called out, is incredibly medically unethical. Research should not endanger the participants of the research, unless they are of course made aware of and agree to the endangerment. The research futhermore should not break the confidentiality or harm the employabilty of the participant, even if they are made aware that it may. To do both of these things such that an entire community is aware of it's proceedings, even if there is a legal disciplinary investigation justifying it, is shameful on the part of the medical practitioners. I hope the medical community of Montclair can share this feeling - that no actions I have taken justify the actions taken not only against me, but that the actions against me were taken in such a way that most of the community could become aware as a matter of gossip. This will result in children approaching medicine for all the wrong reasons.

2. "Othering" within communities, is bad, and goes against the basic idea of what Montclair advertises itself as, a progressive, and diverse community. Furthermore, the act is mentally damaging to those young enough to witness it. Bob Dylan's first line in _Desolation Row_ is a personal memory of his father's childhood about the glamourized hanging of three black men, and reveals that othering does not only cause trauma on those others, but those that witness it, know it's wrong, and can do nothing of it. This trauma has intergenerational echoes, and was passed on from Dylan's father's childhood - he was 8 at the time - to his singer songwriter son. My personal situation has traumatized many simply by the fact that it could have happened, and been condoned, and the children of this town need to know it was wrong, and be told this from authorities they trust, lest they teach their own children in the future something more dangerous.

3. Taylor Swift once said in a song "it must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero." Perhaps one day she'll account for an explanation as Dylan did for _Desolation Row_. My personal interpretation is that you are not supposed to root for the anti-hero: that ideally, you never even know they existed or did what they did in the first place, if they were to be successful in being an anti-hero. Many communities suffer from prejudice and wrongdoing of all kinds, even Montclair. The only salve for such things are often "anti hero" figures, those that must reach past the norms of social boundaries, or even the current law, such to see that something more just occurs. I think of Oskar Schindler, who saved many Jewish people from the worst of the Holocaust. While the Speilberg movie about Schindler did come out, he needed WWII to end for it to even be considered. For Schindler's work to have happened, he needed the cloak of secrecy, or at least it's lesser form of deniability. Harriet Tubman may be an even better example, as her risks did not come with the rewards of industry that Schindler received, and involved secrecy in it's most traditional form, the cloak of darkness. I hope we'll see that twenty dollar bill with her face on it one day in this country. This is all to say that if you're "always rooting for the anti hero", you will be exhausted, for you were never supposed to know or be able to speak about them in the first place, and you will be left defending them in a society normalizing, however banal, evil. At least that's my interpretation of Swift's words. But, if you are the anti hero, or wish to be, the main requirement is this: you're not in it for the recognition.

4. Whitney Houston once said "I believe the children are our future. Teach them well, and let them lead the way." As for the children, I do not believe this situation has "taught them well." This process has literally taught perhaps the most historically impressionable subset of humans, teenage boys, how to get away with criminal behavior. It's also taught them how to use politics, finance, jurisprudence, and other forms of cognitive bias to aide their efforts in enlisting others. Many of the teenage boys in Montclair are of dynastic wealth, and this worries me. I think of how cheap USB web cam spycraft led to [a suicide in Rutgers univesity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Tyler_Clementi) over a decade ago. I shudder when I think of not only the advancements such technology has taken, but alongside a growing amount of students learning how computers work - and unwork - our society as a matter of their education. Hillary Clinton once popularized in America the African proverb that "it takes a village to raise a child" - this here village may have raised a bunch of creepy stalkers and given them ways to be successful no less. It will take a village to unteach them what they've learned, though I suspect many of those teenage boys in question agree with me that they should have never witnessed any of this in the first place, and I feel they may indeed grow to be the men, women, and others that unteach this tragedy to their own children.

...

None of you were ever supposed to know I was "talking to myself" as a matter of pure consent, and when I realized legal, media, and medical actors were risking their careers and reputations listening to me, I did not stop "talking to myself" as a means to prove the point that such behavior was not just amoral on their part, but it would be bad for them.

I'm going to pause making content and just go back to "talking to myself."

To those who happened to bear witness or be involved by happenstance, even and perhaps especially the artists I may have accidently inspired, it is my deepest regret you came to know about me this way. It's kind of fucked my whole thing up. Also, I'm much nicer in person.

To those legal actors that need to defend their very careers by proving some point of value can be made by spying on me while "talking to myself", I ask this - are you winning yet? I'll give you a chance to keep trying. It's my hill you're on after all. You haven't left, and I'm not dead yet.
