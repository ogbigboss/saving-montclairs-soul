# Sermons to Save Montclair's Soul

Montclair NJ has been greatly damaged by the past 7 months and the attempt to make a false reality television show.

It's children - particularly it's teenage boys - have unfortunately been taught how to stalk, harass, and intimidate "others" - and get away with it. These children have been done unspeakable damage by being exposed to all this.

It is on the greater parenting community of Montclair NJ to bring healing to their people, to their children. It is only on me to point out what has happened and perhaps offer some guidance as to why I think all of this _did_ happen.

I think God brought us all together so the parenting community of Montclair NJ can have a wake up call: they are destroying the minds of their children by teaching them criminal behaviors and the borders of society one can get away with such behaviors. They are teaching young people how to manufacture an "other" and turn a whole community against a single person. They are teaching their children how to gaslight not as an individual: but as a community standard.

Many of these young men are or will be going to college soon and will likely take these behaviors to task against women, minorities, LGBTQs, and other less represented people, or of course their own friends. They may talk of this story to someone who has been radicalized on the internet and then Montclair NJ has weaponized a bigot without even knowing it, and all in the pursuit of a Reality TV show which was a lie.
 
I think God, or the Gods, or the Fates and the Furies - whomever you wish - made this happen to give Montclair NJ a chance to redeem itself. This situation is not what it is guilty of, but rather that this situation could have occurred due to the anti-family community culture that a sect of Montclair has promoted. I was just the vehicle to highlight the anti-humanist behavior that has come to define Montclair NJ, and to give this town - which was once very special and an example to other communities - a chance at change.

It's up to all of you to make the change, but I will use this space to highlight perspectives that may help Montclair NJ _not_ become a training ground for the terrorism that it has taught it's children through the last 7 months.

I'll begin posting sermons by text here and recording them in video elsewhere before the next Montclair PTA meeting March 12.
